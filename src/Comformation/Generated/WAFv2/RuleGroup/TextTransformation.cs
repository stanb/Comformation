        /// characters that aren&#39;t valid.

        /// all of the command.
        /// Delete the following characters: \ &quot; &#39; ^ Delete spaces before the following characters: / ( Replace
        /// the following characters with a space: , ; Replace multiple spaces with one space Convert uppercase
        /// letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

        /// \f, formfeed, decimal 12 \t, tab, decimal 9 \n, newline, decimal 10 \r, carriage return, decimal 13
        /// \v, vertical tab, decimal 11 Non-breaking space, decimal 160
        /// COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

        /// html#characters. This function uses up to two bytes in the decoding process, so it can help to
        /// uncover ASCII characters that were encoded using CSS encoding that wouldnâ€™t typically be encoded.
        /// It&#39;s also useful in countering evasion, which is a combination of a backslash and non-hexadecimal
        /// characters. For example, ja\vascript for javascript.

        /// \?, \&#39;, \&quot;, \xHH (hexadecimal), \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren&#39;t valid remain in the output.

        /// performs these operations:
        /// Replaces (ampersand)quot; with &quot; Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

        /// range of FF01-FF5E, then the higher byte is used to detect and adjust the lower byte. If not, only
        /// the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed, causing a possible loss of information.
        /// LOWERCASE - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).
        /// MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the data in the input. The computed hash is in a raw binary form.
        /// NONE - Specify NONE if you don&#39;t want any text transformations.

        /// that are not at the beginning of the input from an input string.
        /// NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as NORMALIZE_PATH, but first converts backslash characters to
        /// forward slashes.
        /// REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes from the input.
        /// REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace each occurrence of a C-style comment (/* . . . */) with a single space.
        /// Multiple consecutive occurrences are not compressed. Unterminated comments are also replaced with a
        /// space (ASCII 0x20). However, a standalone termination of a comment (*/) is not acted upon.

        /// SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode SQL hex data. Example (0x414243) will be decoded to (ABC).
        /// URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.
        /// URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE, but with support for Microsoft-specific %u encoding. If the code

        /// lower byte. Otherwise, only the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed.
